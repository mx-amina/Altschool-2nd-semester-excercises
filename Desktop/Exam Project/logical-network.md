## Question
----
### Define a logical network on the cloud


## Answer
----
### A logical network is a virtual representation of a system that appears to the client as a fully isolated and independent system, although it is physically a part of a larger system or a neighborhood. It can also be an element created by many different networks and created into a single network. This is often used as part of virtual situations where a physical and virtual network is running; therefore, thanks to the convenience and capacity, the separate network can be converted into a single sensitive logical network.
